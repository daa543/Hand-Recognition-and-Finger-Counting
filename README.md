# Hand-Recognition-and-Finger-Counting
The Hand Recognition and Finger Counting is to analyze images of hands to determine if the hand is left or right and to count the number of visible fingers. We use computer vision techniques to accurately identify and label the hand, as well as count the fingers present in the image.
